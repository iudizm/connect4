## Rules of the game

The game is played by a Human vs. the Machine.

Human and Machine alternate to make moves, positioning the pieces that will fall from the top of one of the 7 columns.

The first one to connect 4 pieces on the board wins.

The connections can be: horizontal, vertical, diagonal.

## Machine plays random

Using the Random.org `true randomness` generation API, the Bot Player gets the _randomliest_ moves ever.
